# Adversarial Examples (Intriguing Properties of Neural Networks)

* This folder illustrates the experiment performed by Authors of IPNN to attack a neural network to misclassify a given image by adding small perturbations. 
* Currently it is in progress of showing the FC adversarial attack example using L-BFGS minimizer.
